# MixedMotionCueingEffects

MixedMotionCueingEffects is an experiment program for a study exploring whether the attentional phenomenon of 'inhibition of return' (IOR) is due to inhibition for locations in space or inhibition for objects. In this experiment, target placeholder boxes can either be stationary or rotate 90Â° either clockwise or counterclockwise following a cue stimulus, and targets can appear at any one of the four (top, bottom, left, or right) locations. 

The experiment also compares performance in the different motion conditions between when participants are asked to respond to targets by making saccades towards them (the **saccade** condition) and when participants are asked to make a speeded detection response for them via the keyboard without moving their eyes (the **keypress** condition).

## Requirements

MixedMotionCueingEffects is programmed in Python 2.7 using the [KLibs framework](https://github.com/a-hurst/klibs). It has been developed and tested on macOS (10.9 through 10.13), but should also work with minimal hassle on computers running [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) Linux. It is not currently compatible with any version of Windows, nor will it run under the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, you will need to install the KLibs framework by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/a-hurst/klibs).

Then, you can then download and install the experiment program with the following commands (replacing `~/Downloads` with the path to the folder where you would like to put the program folder):

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/TheKleinLab/MixedMotionCueingEffects.git
```

### Running the Experiment

MixedMotionCueingEffects is a KLibs experiment, meaning that it is run using the `klibs` command at the terminal (running the 'experiment.py' file using python directly will not work).

To run the experiment, navigate to the MixedMotionCueingEffects folder in Terminal and run `klibs run [screensize]`,
replacing `[screensize]` with the diagonal size of your display in inches (e.g. `klibs run 24` for a 24-inch monitor). If you just want to test the program out for yourself and skip demographics collection, you can add the `-d` flag to the end of the command to launch the experiment in development mode.

#### Optional Settings

In the experiment, participants are placed into one of two response conditions: the **keypress** conditon, where participant responds to targets using the space bar while keeping their eyes in the middle of the screen, or the **saccade** condition, where the participant responds to targets by making saccades towards them.

To choose which condition to run, launch the experiment with the `--condition` or `-c` flag, followed by either `keypress` or `saccade`. For example, if you wanted to run the saccade response condition on a computer with a 19-inch monitor, you would run 

```
klibs run 19 --condition saccade
```

If no condition is manually specified, the experiment program defaults to running the keypress response condition.
